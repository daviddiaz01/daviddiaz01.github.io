### About the Project  
This project focuses on developing a line-following robot, an autonomous system that uses sensors to detect and follow a path. The robot integrates multiple subsystems, each responsible for specific functions such as sensor detection, motor control, power regulation, and communication.  

As part of this team project, I am responsible for the Sensor Subsystem, which plays a crucial role in detecting the path and guiding the robotâ€™s movement. The ESP32-S3 microcontroller processes sensor data, while the color sensor detects line contrast to enable precise navigation.  

### Key Objectives  
- **Autonomous Navigation** â€“ Enable the robot to follow a designated path using real-time sensor input.  
- **Efficient Data Processing** â€“ Use the ESP32-S3 to analyze sensor readings and send commands.  
- **Stable Power Management** â€“ Ensure reliable voltage conversion and power supply for all components.  

### Project Subsystems  
| Subsystem         | Function  |  
|------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| **Sensor Subsystem**  | Detects line contrast and sends data to MCU |  
| **Motor Control** | Controls wheel movement based on sensor input |  
| **Power Management** | Regulates voltage for stable operation |  
| **Communication** | Interfaces with external controllers for debugging |  

### Development Process  
1. **Component Selection** â€“ Research and select the best components for performance and efficiency.  
2. **Circuit Design & PCB Layout** â€“ Design and integrate components into a functional circuit.  
3. **Firmware Development** â€“ Implement software for sensor communication and data processing.  
4. **Testing & Optimization** â€“ Ensure the system operates accurately under different conditions.
